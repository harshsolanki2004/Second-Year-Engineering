In the second lab, I learned how to implement complex numbers in Java, and leanred how to create multiple classes within the same project and
have a separate class for the main method.
In the ComplexNumber class, I implemented multiple methods in this lab, including multiplying a complex number, dividing a complex number, finding its reciprocal etc.
The ComplexTry file was where the main method was implemented and in that I implemented multiple tests that check the methods and verified them with solutions done by hand.
