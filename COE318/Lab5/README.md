In this lab i used interfaces and inheritance to create a blackjack game
There is a card object, in which each house is assigned a number from 0-3 and it contains boolean methods which retun true or false if the card is facing up or facing down.
There is a card pile class in which there are methods to add cards to the pile and remove cards from the pile.
and there are other classes in which the game is actually played. a card is dealt, and it is compared to another card and checks its value 0-14
