In this lab i learned how to implement arraylists with the concept of a circuit
There is a circuit class that initializes an arraylist of resistors and it has a method to add resistors to the list
in the resistor class, there are two variables created to represent the nodes of each resistor. an exception is thrown if the nodes are null
values because that would mean the resistor doesn't exist.
the main method creates nodes and creates resistors assigning the nodes to the resistors, adds them to the arraylist and prints out the list of resistors
