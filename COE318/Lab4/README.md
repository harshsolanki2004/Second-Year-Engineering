In this lab I used the concept of multiple classes and main classes that are interconnected and can use public methods from each other.
The goal of this lab was to create a banking application that creates an account object with an accountholder's name, bank's name, account number, balance, and whether they want to deposit or withdraw money.
Additionally, the applicaion can also create bank objects, in which we can see the number of accounts active in each bank, or add/remove an account. using booloean statements to check if the account with the given account number exists in the bank and if it holds enough money to withdraw a certain amount.
