In this course I designed a multi-stage BJT amplifier with a common-collector and common-emitter configuration, achieving a 50x amplification of the input signal.

I applied DC and AC analysis techniques to design each stage using limited resistor and capacitor values.
I used NI Multisim and its tools to accurately measure the voltage gain, resistance, and capacitace.
I calculated open-loop and closed-loop gains to optimize performance.
